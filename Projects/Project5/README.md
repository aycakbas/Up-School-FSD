We have developed a todo application in this project. We used TypeScript and Semantic UI for this purpose. The application was built using React. The required features of the application are as follows:

1) The "Add" button should be disabled until a todo is entered.

2) Users should be able to sort their todos by date and time in any desired way.

3) When a todo is double-clicked, it should be displayed with a strikethrough effect. Double-clicking again should remove the strikethrough effect and return it to its normal state.

4) Users should be able to delete todos.
